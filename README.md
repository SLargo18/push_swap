# ♻️ push_swap

## 📌 Description

`push_swap` is an algorithmic project that sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations on two stacks. The goal is to sort the data with the smallest possible number of instructions.

This project challenges your skills in algorithm design, data structure manipulation, and optimization under strict constraints, using only the C programming language.
